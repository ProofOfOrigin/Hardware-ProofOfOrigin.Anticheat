Using hardware Blockchains to whitelist users! We track hardware, it's firmware, & UUIDs from the Manufacturer, to Retailer, to the Buider or OEM. With virtualization and EEPROMs You can spoof motherboards - but with Uni.os UniKey Kernel modules, with ProofOfOrigin Blockchain, You Cannot spoof! And have to buy all new hardware if you get caught!


Additional:
- Use UniCloud/MAAS to detect Hardware and fingerprint the OS & drivers, on a Gaming PC
- Run a kernel module that detects DMA PCIe cards
